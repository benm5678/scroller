# Description

Purpose of tool is to easily add music sheet / chord tabs (or any text or photo list) you want as 'documents' and be able to auto scroll them per set speed.

## Goals

- Easy to add/edit document items
  -  Can contain text or photo list
- Work offline as PWA
- Prevent device screen from locking when Auto Scroll activated
  - In current version it allows 3 minutes of no scroll time and then it disables it & stops the screen lock prevention (to avoid battery waste)
- Sync / save / restore to data storage of choice (local, dropbox, google drive, etc.)

## Todo

- Finish initial basic implementation

## Backlog

- Allow sorting / shuffle
- Add playlist support
- Allow to find/import from tab sites?
- OCR support?
